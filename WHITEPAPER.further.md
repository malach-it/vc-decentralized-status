# The existence phenomenon

## First reflection (uncomplete)

Annotations are a creation of life to facilitate imitation games.

Imitation games are a set of challenges / replies that permit to form a complete space.

Complete spaces are singularities that allow to create a kagome network.

## Introduction

The recursive annotation / imitation game / accumutation to annotate phnomenon allow to create the denotation at the origin of the reality associated to it. Then reality would have the structure of a kagome network taking into account that denotation is at the origin of references that form a tree that is tied taking ancestry into account (with the meaning of denotation and refenrece given by semantics). The whole provide meaning.

The discussion of this present paper give insights about the before described phenomenon. Starting by stating the definitions of the actors

The lack of completeness in the denotation is at the origin of incertainity, the origin of the next challenges. Linked to the cartesian doubt and choice axiom. kagome networks are the minimal structures that follow the choice axiom.

Matter is the reply to a challenge created by the unstability of anti-matter that tends to be complete. Aspects of antimatter that are certain are the material of created matter in reply of the unstability caused by antimatter that is uncomplete. This taking into account that what is human follow the same principles of reality. Maybe.

When matter collide antimatter, a paradox results by the fact that antimatter does not respect the axiom of choice anymore and results an infinite chain of challenge replies looking for stability. Notion of ideal.

stability == respecting the axiom of choice
stability == being complete

Denotation tends to be complete.

initiation of the recursion is out of the scope of this paper.

## Annotation

## Imitation game

Challenging an entity according to the reply forms a chain to accumulate facts. Those create a denotation giving birth to references that challenge again the entity. The reply chains create patterns that, taken as a whole, form the denotation of the entity. The uncertain patterns are challenged until creating a complete space.
