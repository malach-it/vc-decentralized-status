## Introduction

In the real world, people use identity aspects to adapt their response to ones requests. Can it be for their posture or to define a social meaningful class, aspects drive our interactions in a daily manner. Moral persons have the same behaviour defining their acts. Those makes the notion of identity aspect predominant in social interactions.

Seeing the digital identity as claims about an entity, a subset of them can define such aspects. Here we will get interest about the notion of category beside the data (the claims) and the annotations it can be linked to.

Annotating aspects helps having a more accurate sense of their validity or better adapt the interactions with the person, providing credit to the emitting authority. Annotations give, this way, a manner to weight the data itself.

Categories are the key discriminant to provide a custom service, we may be aware of the importance of those. They can be a factor of discrimination in a law sense, most of them being part of the private domain for individuals. The definition of the subsidient categories is made by the peers' or authorities' interpretation of identity aspects.

The categorization of individuals can be a threat if not taken anonymously and in a privacy preserving way. Discrimination is the first appearing danger which can be derived to many others.
