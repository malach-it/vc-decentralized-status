# About anotation and digital identity

## Glossary

Anotation
-> short explanation or opinion for a text or image

Digital identity
-> data stored on computer systems relating to an individual, organization, application, or device

Digital identity aspect
-> set of claims helping to assert a property or to provide a service

## Introduction

In the real world, people use identity aspects to adapt their response to ones requests. Can it be for their posture or to define a social meaningful class, aspects drive our interactions in a daily manner. Moral persons have the same behaviour defining their acts. Those makes the notion of identity aspect predominant in social interactions.

Seeing the digital identity as claims about an entity, a subset of them can define such aspects. Here we will get interest about the notion of category beside the data (the claims) and the anotations it can be linked to.

Annotating aspects helps having a more accurate sense of their validity or better adapt the interactions with the person, providing credit to the emitting authority. Anotations give, this way, a manner to weight the data itself.

Categories are the key discriminant to provide a custom service, we may be aware of the importance of those. They can be a factor of discrimination in a law sense, most of them being part of the private domain for individuals. The definition of the categories is made by the peers' or authorities' interpretation of identity aspects.

The categorization of individuals can be a threat if not taken anonymously and in a privacy preserving way. Discrimination is the first appearing danger which can be derived to many others.

## Identity aspects and granularity

- identity aspect definition

### the purpose and the aspects

- aspects are sets of claims that are made on purpose (usable peace of information)
- the purposes in the digital world
- those sets overlap taking whole or parts of identity claims
- claims are assertions about an entity and can be encapsulated to be shared

### the data and the context

- sharing identity information is made in a context
- the asserting authority (self assertions, external assertions)
- gathering information about an entity, deducing the claims
- identity information are taken targeting an objective building aspects

### necessary and sufficient

- take only the necessary identity information to deserve a purpose -> disclosures
- the danger of more than sufficient, meeting other purposes
- subsets of aspects can deserve other purposes than the original -> zero knowledge proofs
- the sufficient to be trusted, when not enough comes the anotations

## Annotating digital identity aspects

- anotation definition

### types of anotations

- categorizing anotations, when the possible anotations are of the same category
- sorted anotation categories enable to sort the entities
- the will to weight the data according to a purpose

### sources of anotations

- the authority and the weight
- the statistical weight, when multiple anotations anotate the same data
- identity information is used to anotate, the need of other aspects (the more, the stronger)

### about proximity

- same anotations can be made to different aspects
- the closest to the data the less confusion
- the anotation does not alter the data
- when the purpose is categorization, the proximity bring less failure

## About categories

### data vs anotations
### who is the authority?
### the discriminant factor

## The dangers of anotations
### failing the privacy
### dissonant responses
### an entrypoint for rights
