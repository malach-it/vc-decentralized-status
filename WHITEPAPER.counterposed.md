Data is an annotation that is paradoxal with the reality it denotes.

the data proves the fact

the fact prooves the data

Which proves the paradoxality between the data and the fact

Data not respecting the paradoxality with the fact is not true and does not philosophically exist. It is chaos that is not related to reality. This chaos does not provide meaning and has only the meaning of chaos which is paradoxal.

parallel with the memory and the souvenir

Data is an annotation that is created from a fact, it provides a facet of it helping to provide meaning for the exogene actors. This annotation is part of the reality of the fact not altering it, helping it to accumulate a more complete sense that can be at the origin of other annotations. Annotations that are not paradoxal with the fact alter the sense provided by the fact references that is data itself but can't alter the fact that has the ability to provide more references that can still recover in the formed entity meaning. Human rights are to protect people from such alterations.
